Pirates Online Classic is a fan-made recreation of Disney's now-defunct MMORPG; Pirates of the Caribbean Online. Our project is founded on a promise to our community that we will never charge for full access to anything Pirates Online Classic provides.

## Merging
All merges should go through a three-step process:

    1. PR goes up by creator when the changes are ready
    2. PR is reviewed by another person
    3. PR is reviewed and merged by a third person

For emergency/security merges, only steps 1/2 are required if time is an issue.

## Commit Guidelines
We ask that whenever you make a big change, you make a PR and have it reviewed by another developer, If you need help don't be afraid to ask!

We also ask that you label your commits for what you changed e.g `pirates/piratesbase: patch a crash with piratesbase`
